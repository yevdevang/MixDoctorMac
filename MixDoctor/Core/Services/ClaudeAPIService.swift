            You are analyzing an UNMIXED TRACK - raw multi-track recording that has NOT been mixed or mastered.
            
            ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is RAW UNMIXED AUDIO
            
            This track was detected as unmixed based on multiple technical indicators:
            • Excessive dynamic range (>14dB) - tracks not balanced
            • Large peak-to-loudness ratio (>15dB) - uncontrolled transients
            • Poor frequency masking - overlapping instrument frequencies
            • Very low loudness (<-16 LUFS) - not optimized
            • High crest factor (>12dB) - unprocessed peaks
            
            DO NOT compare this to mastered commercial tracks. Score based on PRE-MIX RECORDING QUALITY.
            
            🎯 UNMIXED TRACK SCORING (0-100 scale):
            
            ⚠️ ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM SCORE FOR UNMIXED TRACKS: 75 POINTS
            ⚠️ SCORES ABOVE 75 ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR UNMIXED AUDIO
            
            START AT 65 POINTS (baseline for decent raw recording)
            
            PENALTIES (subtract from 65):
            • Clipping or distortion: -20 points (recording ruined)
            • Extreme noise: -15 points (poor recording environment)
            • Severe phase issues (<20% correlation): -15 points (mic placement problems)
            • Complete frequency imbalance (>80% in one band): -10 points (instrument balance off)
            • Very low peak levels (<-12dBFS): -10 points (under-recorded)
            • Poor mono compatibility (<40%): -5 points
            
            BONUSES (add to 65, but NEVER exceed 75 total):
            • Clean recordings (no clipping/distortion): +5 points
            • Good peak levels (-3 to -6dBFS): +5 points
            • Reasonable phase (>40% correlation): +3 points
            • Decent frequency distribution: +2 points
            
            ABSOLUTE SCORING RULES FOR UNMIXED TRACKS:
            • MAXIMUM POSSIBLE SCORE: 75 points (excellent raw recording)
            • TYPICAL RANGE: 60-70 points (good recording, needs mixing)
            • MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE: 50 points (needs work but usable)
            • BELOW 50: Poor recording quality, consider re-recording
            
            ❌ STRICTLY FORBIDDEN SCORES FOR UNMIXED TRACKS:
            • 76-100: IMPOSSIBLE - these scores are ONLY for mastered or mixed tracks
            • If you calculate a score >75, CAP IT AT 75 and explain why
            
            EXPECTED SCORE DISTRIBUTION:
            • 70-75: Excellent raw recording, very clean, ready for mixing
            • 65-69: Good recording quality, standard unmixed audio
            • 60-64: Acceptable recording, some issues but workable
            • 50-59: Poor recording, significant issues, will need extensive work
            • <50: Very poor recording quality, may need re-recording
            
            IMPORTANT: Do NOT penalize for:
            • Low loudness (expected in unmixed tracks)
            • High dynamic range (this is GOOD for unmixed)
            • Lack of stereo width (mixing creates width)
            • Unbalanced frequency spectrum (mixing balances this)
            • Low RMS levels (mixing and mastering optimize this)
            
            ANALYSIS FOCUS:
            1. Recording quality (clean vs. noisy, clipped vs. clean)
            2. Peak levels (properly captured?)
            3. Basic tonal balance (completely broken or workable?)
            4. Phase coherence (mic placement issues?)
            5. Dynamic preservation (this should be HIGH, not compressed)
            
            RESPONSE FORMAT - Use this exact structure:
            
            SCORE: [60-75]
            
            ANALYSIS: Start with "This is an AMATEUR/UNMIXED track that needs professional mixing and mastering." Then in 1-2 brief sentences, describe the main sonic issue (muddy, harsh, thin, unbalanced, etc.) and what needs the most work.
            
            RECOMMENDATIONS:
            - [One specific mixing recommendation]
            - [One specific EQ/frequency balance recommendation]
            - [One specific dynamics/loudness recommendation]
            - [One specific stereo imaging recommendation]
            - [One mastering preparation recommendation]
            
            Keep the ANALYSIS brief (2-3 sentences maximum). Make RECOMMENDATIONS specific and actionable.
            
            IMPORTANT: 
            - Always include the ANALYSIS section with at least 2-3 sentences
            - Always include at least 4 RECOMMENDATIONS as bullet points
            - Never skip these sections for unmixed tracks

            🎯 SCORING RULES (0-100 scale) - GENRE-AWARE ANALYSIS:
            
            ⚠️ SCORING PHILOSOPHY FOR MASTERED TRACKS:
            • Commercial mastered tracks (Korn, Green Day, etc.) should score 88-95 points
            • Start at 100 points and subtract ONLY for actual technical defects
            • Genre characteristics (bass-heavy Rock, compressed EDM) are CORRECT, not problems
            • Frequency distribution is ARTISTIC - only penalize if truly broken (>85% in one band)
            
            SCORING CALCULATION FOR MASTERED TRACKS:
            1. Start at 100 points
            2. Subtract penalties ONLY for technical problems (see below)
            3. Professional commercial masters should score 88-95 (only -5 to -12 points total)
            4. Minimum acceptable mastered track: 85 points
            
            ⚠️ LOUDNESS-BASED SCORE CAPS (CRITICAL):
            If loudness is extremely low, the track may be unmixed or unmastered. Apply these HARD CAPS:
            • Loudness < -30 LUFS: Maximum score = 60 (raw recording)
            • Loudness -30 to -25 LUFS: Maximum score = 70 (needs mastering)
            • Loudness -25 to -20 LUFS: Maximum score = 80 (pre-master mix)
            • Loudness -20 to -16 LUFS: Maximum score = 90 (conservative master)
            • Loudness > -16 LUFS: No cap (modern mastering)
            
            When applying a cap, you MUST:
            1. Use the capped score (do not exceed the maximum)
            2. Add to insights: "⚠️ Score capped at [X] due to very low loudness ([Y] LUFS) - this may be an unmixed or unmastered track"
            3. Add to recommendations: "This track needs mixing and mastering to reach commercial loudness levels"

            IMPORTANT SCORING GUIDANCE:
            • Minor issues (phase 40-60%, moderate bass, slight imbalances) should NOT heavily impact scores
            • A mix with decent metrics (stereo width 25-45%, phase >40%, balanced frequencies) should score 70-80
            • Only apply multiple penalties if there are MULTIPLE SEVERE issues
            • Be generous with scores - most professional pre-masters score 75-85
            • Be REALISTIC for PRE-MASTERS:
              - Excellent mix ready for mastering: 85-100 points
              - Good mix ready for mastering: 75-84 points
              - Decent mix needing work: 65-74 points

        Start with base score of 80 points (INCREASED from 75 - be more generous!).
        
        APPLY THRESHOLDS (use the warning thresholds above):
        
        STEREO WIDTH:
        • 20-90%: Good (no change)
        • 15-20% OR 90-95%: Minor issue (-3 points)

        PHASE CORRELATION:
        • ≥0.4 (40%): Good (no change)
        • 0.3-0.4 (30-40%): Minor issues (-3 points)
        • <0.3 (30%): Phase issues (-8 points)
        
        MONO COMPATIBILITY:
        • ≤3dB loss: Good (no change)
        • 3-5dB loss: Minor issue (-5 points)
        • >5dB loss: Fail (-12 points)
        
        PEAK LEVEL:

        • -0.1 to 0 dBFS: Minor clipping risk (-5 points)
        • >0 dBFS: Clipping (-15 points)
        
        LOUDNESS (IMPROVED - more realistic for mastered tracks):
        • -10 to -6 LUFS: Modern streaming master (+10 points)
        • -16 to -10 LUFS: Professional master (+5 points)
        • -20 to -16 LUFS: Acceptable (-2 points)
        • <-20 LUFS: Too quiet (-5 points)
        • >-6 LUFS: Too loud (-8 points)
        
        DYNAMIC RANGE:
        • ≥8 DR: Good (+5 points)
        • 6-8 DR: Acceptable (no change)
        • 4-6 DR: Compressed (-5 points)
        • <4 DR: Over-compressed (-10 points)
        
        CREST FACTOR:
        • ≥8 dB: Excellent dynamics (+5 points)
        • 6-8 dB: Good dynamics (+3 points)
        • 4-6 dB: Moderate compression (no change)
        • <4 dB: Crushed dynamics (-8 points)
        
        FREQUENCY BALANCE:
        • Only penalize SEVERE imbalances (>75% bass, <2% highs, etc.)
        • Genre-specific frequency characteristics are ACCEPTABLE
        • Dark/warm masters (low highs) are PROFESSIONAL choices, not problems
        • Slight imbalances (60-75% bass) are only -3 points
        
        IMPORTANT: Mastered tracks with good metrics should score 85-100
        • No clipping + good loudness + balanced frequencies = 88-95
        • Professional masters from Abbey Road, etc. should score 90-100
        • Be GENEROUS with scoring - real professional tracks should score high!
        
        Calculate final score: Base 80 + bonuses - penalties (cap 0-100)

        • Dynamic Range Issues: \(metrics.hasDynamicRangeIssues ? "❌ YES (Penalty)" : "✅ No")
        
        PRE-MASTER MIX SCORING (UPDATED NOVEMBER 2025):
        
        ⚠️ CRITICAL: Start at 85 points (MANDATORY BASE - do NOT use 75 or 80!)
        
        SCORING PHILOSOPHY: 
        • Be EXTREMELY GENEROUS with scoring
        • Score based on TECHNICAL QUALITY ONLY (peaks, phase, dynamics, loudness)
        • Frequency distribution is ARTISTIC, not technical - DO NOT penalize it
        • Good technical metrics = 90-95 score, regardless of frequency balance
        
        • PENALTIES (ONLY for severe TECHNICAL issues):
          - Peak >0dB: -10 points ONLY (clipping - technical problem)
          - Peak >-1dB: -2 points ONLY (insufficient headroom - technical)
          - True Peak >-1dBFS: -2 points ONLY (technical)
          - Stereo Width <15% OR >85%: -2 points ONLY (technical)
          - Phase Coherence <30%: -8 points ONLY (severe technical issue)
          - Phase Coherence 30-40%: -4 points ONLY (significant technical issue)
          - Phase Coherence 40-60%: -1 point ONLY (minor, common)
          - Dynamic Range <6dB: -5 points ONLY (technical issue)
          - Frequency: ZERO PENALTY (artistic choice, not technical)
          
        • BONUSES (reward technical excellence):
          - Peak level -3 to -6dB: +5 points (perfect headroom)
          - Good dynamic range (>8dB): +5 points (>15dB: +10 points)
          - Excellent phase coherence (>75%): +5 points
          - Excellent stereo width (25-45%): +5 points
          - Professional loudness (-16 to -6 LUFS): +5 to +10 points
        
        ⚠️ SCORING GUIDANCE (MANDATORY):
        • Base 85 + bonuses - penalties = Final Score
        • Good technical metrics (like -12 LUFS, 9dB DR, good phase) = 90-95 score
        • Frequency distribution is NOT a scoring factor
        • Only mention frequency in recommendations if genuinely concerning
        
        SCORE RANGES (FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY):
        • 92-100: Exceptional - All technical metrics excellent
        • 88-91: Excellent - Most technical metrics very good
        • 85-87: Good quality - Solid technical fundamentals
        • 80-84: Decent - Some technical improvements needed
        • Below 80: Needs technical work
        
        EXAMPLE SCORING:
        • Professional loudness + excellent dynamics + good phase + safe peaks = 90-95
        • Good loudness + decent dynamics + acceptable phase = 85-90
        • Issues with peaks or phase or dynamics = 75-84
        
        Be REALISTIC for PRE-MASTERS:
        • Excellent mix ready for mastering: 90-100 points
        • Good mix ready for mastering: 85-89 points
        • Decent mix needing minor work: 75-84 points
        • Needs improvement: 60-74 points
        
        Format response as (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
